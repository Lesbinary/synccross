### Notes

Some LSDj modes work regardless of the port of `synccross` but for complete compatibility, always connect the Master/Lead/Input port in the upper port of `synccross`.

Please, connect the link cables facing the 'two point' side up. The upper side of `synccross` is the one with `SNCRS` written on it:

### How to order

I'm using OSH Park, as they support Kicad pcb files straight, but any other service compatible with these files should work.

You can directly order it without uploading any model using this link: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/tU7dDyJb

Otherwise, if you want to upload the model manually, then:

Go to OSH park website -> browse for files

Locate kicad pcb file

Check design and modify your order
