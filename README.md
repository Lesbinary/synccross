### Notes

Some LSDj modes work regardless of the port of `synccross` but for complete compatibility, always connect the Master/Lead/Input port in the upper port of `synccross`.

Please, connect the link cables facing the 'two point' side up. The upper side of `synccross` is the one with `SNCRS` written on it.



### How to order

I'm using OSH Park for this example, as they support Kicad pcb files straight:

Go to OSH park website -> browse for files

Locate kicad pcb file
