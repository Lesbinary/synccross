## LSDj sync 4 port adapter
LSDj sync 4 MGB/CGB port type adapter, for DMG/MGB/GBC link cables only (Game Boy second generation).

NOTE: It does not connect all pins, so mGB, LSDJ keyboard mode, LSDJ MIDI Out and Nanoloop sync don't not work.

How to order:

I'm using OSH Park for this example, as they support Kicad pcb files straight:

Go to OSH park website -> browse for files

Locate kicad pcb file

Check design and modify your order
